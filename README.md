# Boogle

I have created an simple app , in which the player needs to find the sum of of randomly selected 3*3 matrix , in a grid of 8*8.I tried implementing Fenwick tree or 2d binary indexed trees. Main benefit of this tree is it not only have O(logN) for time complexity, but O(log N) for space complexity.
